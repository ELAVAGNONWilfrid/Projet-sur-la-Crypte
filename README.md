# Project-on-the-Crypt
This project involves using a DHT11 temperature sensor and passive buzzer with an Arduino Uno board to simulate an ancient artifact that responds to breath by playing a melody. The goal is to cool the sensor to trigger melodies.
# Context
You are in a dark and mysterious room. In the middle, there is a strange object: a small crystal connected to a box that can play music.
On the crystal it is written:
“Only the breath of the stars will reveal the melody.”
You understand that this crystal is like a magic thermometer (the TMP36 sensor). He measures the temperature around him. If the air is too hot, it remains silent. But if you blow on it to cool it, it activates and plays a melody thanks to the sound box (the buzzer).
Challenge: blow on the sensor to lower the temperature and trigger the music!
